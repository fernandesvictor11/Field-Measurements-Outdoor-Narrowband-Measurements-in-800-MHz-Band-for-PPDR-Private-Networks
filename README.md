This .csv file contains received power measurements captured by researchers from Universidade Federal Fluminense (UFF), in the neighborhood of Icaraí, Niterói - RJ, Brazil.

Each measurement is associated with a value of latitude, longitude, and distance from the transmitter.

The file contains, in this order, the data: Latitude (decimal)-Longitude (decimal)-Distance (km)-Received Power (dBm).

The calculated distance is relative to the transmitter, located at latitude 22°54'9.83" S and longitude 43° 6'57.63" O.

Additional information about the measurement campaign and the study done with these measurements can be found in the paper:
